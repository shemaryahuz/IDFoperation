# IDF Operation - C# Project

## 🧭 Overview

This C# project simulates a simplified military operation involving the **IDF (Israel Defense Forces)** and **Hamas**.  
It uses interfaces, abstract classes, and OOP design to represent the structure and behavior of military organizations, intelligence analysis, and strike operations. Object creation for entities like terrorists, strike options, and intelligence messages is managed by a system of factory classes, potentially utilizing an external data generation service (simulating the Gemini API).

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### 🧱 Abstract Classes & Interfaces

- **`Organization`** *(abstract)*  
  Base class for both `IDF` and `Hamas`.

- **`IStrikeOption`** *(interface)*  
  Implemented by all strike option types (`Plain`, `Drone`, `Artillery`).

---

## 🔷 IDF Classes

- **`IDF`** *(inherits from `Organization`)*
  - Composed of:
    - `IntelUnit` - Gathers and processes intelligence
    - `StrikeUnit` - Manages and executes strike operations

- **`IntelUnit`**
  - Holds:
    - `List<IntelMessage>` - Raw intelligence messages
    - `List<IntelTerrorist>` - Identified terrorists (extended from `Terrorist`)
  - Purpose: Processes messages and identifies threats. `IntelMessage` objects are generated by `IntelMessageFactory`.

- **`IntelMessage`**
  - Represents collected raw intelligence data.

- **`IntelTerrorist`** *(inherits from `Terrorist`)*
  - Enhanced terrorist information obtained through analysis.

- **`StrikeUnit`**
  - Holds:
    - `Dictionary<string, List<IStrikeOption>>`  
      - Keys: `"Plains"`, `"Drones"`, `"Artilleries"`  
      - Values: Lists of strike option implementations
  - Purpose: Executes different types of military strikes. Strike options are generated by `StrikeFactory`.

- **Strike Option Types** *(implement `IStrikeOption`)*
  - `Plain`
  - `Drone`
  - `Artillery`

## 🔴 Hamas Classes

- **`Hamas`** *(inherits from `Organization`)*
  - Holds:
    - `List<Terrorist>` - Operative members. These are generated by `TerroristFactory`.

- **`Terrorist`**
  - Contains identifying information and traits.

---

## 🎮 Controller & Utility Classes

- **`OperationManager`**
  - Main driver of the program.
  - Shows the main menu (using `Displayer`) and executes user choices based on input.
  - Delegates IDF-specific actions to `IDFCommander` and handles overall program flow (like initialization and exiting).

- **`IDFCommander`**
  - Controls operations within the IDF:
    - Handles intelligence processing.
    - Chooses and executes strike actions based on user commands and available intelligence.

- **`Displayer`**
  - Responsible for user interaction:
    - Displays menu options.
    - Shows information about IDF units, status, and operation outcomes.

- **`FactoryManager`**
  - Located in the `Core` folder.
  - Responsible for orchestrating the creation of initial game entities (terrorists, strike options, intel messages) for the operation. It utilizes specific factory classes below.

- **Factory Classes**
  - **`TerroristFactory`** (in `Hamas` folder): Creates `Terrorist` objects, using data from `GeminiService`.
  - **`StrikeFactory`** (in `IDF/StrikeUnit` folder): Creates different types of `IStrikeOption` objects (`Plain`, `Drone`, `Artillery`), using data from `GeminiService`.
  - **`IntelMessageFactory`** (in `IDF/IntelUnit` folder): Creates `IntelMessage` objects, using data from `GeminiService`.

- **`GeminiService` & `GeminiClasses`**
  - Located in the `GeminiService` folder.
  - **`GeminiService`**: Interacts with an external API (simulated Gemini API) to generate data used by the factory classes for creating objects like terrorists, strike options, and intel messages.
  - **`GeminiClasses`**: Contains data structures (e.g., request and response models) for interacting with the Gemini API simulation.

## 🧑‍💻 Program & User Interaction Flow

The program simulation unfolds as follows:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   A welcome message is displayed to the user (simulating the IDF Commander).
    *   The `FactoryManager` is invoked to populate the simulation. It coordinates with:
        *   `TerroristFactory` (using `GeminiService`) to create `Terrorist` objects for Hamas.
        *   `StrikeFactory` (using `GeminiService`) to create `Plain`, `Drone`, and `Artillery` strike options for the IDF's `StrikeUnit`.
        *   `IntelMessageFactory` (using `GeminiService`) to generate `IntelMessage` objects for the IDF's `IntelUnit`.

2.  **Main Operation Loop:**
    The `OperationManager` then presents the user with a menu of options, managed by the `Displayer`. The available actions are:

    1.  **Show all intel terrorists in intel unit**
    2.  **Show all intel messages**
    3.  **Show all strike options**
    4.  **Show the dangerous terrorist that is alive**
    5.  **Show the last message**
    6.  **Attack by dangerous (target the most dangerous identified terrorist)**
    7.  **Attack by last intel message (initiate a strike based on the latest intelligence)**
    8.  **Exit**

    The `OperationManager` receives the user's choice and delegates the execution:
    *   IDF-related actions (viewing intel, executing strikes) are passed to the `IDFCommander`.
    *   The loop continues until the user selects "Exit", at which point the program terminates.
